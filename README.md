Project Overview

This repository contains the materials and final results of my Year 1 individual project. The main focus of this project is to compare two methods of point process simulation: thinning and interval.

Poster.jpg: The final outcome of the project, summarizing the key findings, methods, and results.  
time.R: A comparison of the runtime performance between the thinning method and simulation by interval method.  
special_case.R: This file presents a special scenario where the simulation by interval method does not perform well, illustrating its limitations. 

Conclusion

The results can be seen in the poster.
